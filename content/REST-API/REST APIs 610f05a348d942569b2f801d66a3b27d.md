# REST APIs

---

- REST: **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer
- Interoperability between different web systems
- REST is not â€¦
    - A standard
    - A language
- REST is â€¦
    - A collection of principles
    - Some best practices
    - Usually uses HTTP and JSON

# JSON

---

- JSON: **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation
- Lightweight data-interchange format
- Based on JS syntax
- Commonly used to send data from a server to a web client
- Ubiquitous with REST APIs

## Valid JSON

---

- Validate JSON
    - $ curl -s https://api.github.com/users/iamyoungk | jsonlint
- Pitfall: no trailing commas allowed!
- More details: [http://www.json.org/](http://www.json.org/)

## curl

---

- REST API at the command line
- HTTP `GET` request returns a JSON-formatted string
    - $ curl https://api.github.com/users/iamyoungk

## jq and python

---

- Pretty-print JSON using [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)
    - curl -s [https://api.github.com/users/iamyoungk](https://api.github.com/users/iamyoungk) | jq
- Pretty-print JSON using Python
    - curl -s [https://api.github.com/users/iamyoungk](https://api.github.com/users/iamyoungk) | python -m json.tool

## HTTPie

---

- improved CLI and color coding with httpie
    - $ http https://api.github.com/users/iamyoungk

## Pagination

---

- List views should return a limited number of items
    - What if there were 10 million posts?
- Sensible default, e.g., 10 posts
    - $ curl localhost:8000/api/v1/posts/
- Get the next 10 results
    - $ curl localhost:8000/api/v1/posts/**?page=1**
- Customizable size
    - $ curl localhost:8000/api/v1/posts/**?size=20**

## REST API verbs

---

- GET: return datum
- POST: create new datum
    - Response: includes a copy of the created object (w/ link to itself)
- PATCH: update part of a datum
    - Request: only contains the field that should be modified
    - Response: includes a copy of the entire modified object
- PUT replace the entire datum
    - Request: contains a replacement value for every field
    - Response: includes a copy of the entire modified object
- DELETE: delete datum

## ðŸ‘¾Â REST design principles

---

- Uniform interface
    - Resource-based
    - Manipulation of resources through representations
    - Self-descriptive messages
    - Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS)
- Client-server architecture
- Stateless
- Cacheable
- Layered
- Code on demand (optional)

### Uniform interface: resource-based

---

- Individual resources are identified in requests using URIs as resource identifies.
- Think of a URI like a pointer
- ID in the URL
- GET /api/v1/posts/**1/** HTTP/1.0

### **Uniform interface: manipulation of resources through representations**

---

- When a client holds a representation of a resource, including any metadata attached, it has enough information to modify or delete the resource on the server.
- Object usually contains a link to itself

### **Uniform interface: self-descriptive messages**

---

- Each message includes enough information to describe how to process the message
- Content-Type and charset
    - **`> Content-Type:application/json; charset=utf-8`**

### **Uniform interface: HATEOAS**

---

- Clients deliver state via body contents, query-string parameters, request headers and the requested URI (the resource name).
- Services deliver state to clients via body content, response codes, and response headers. This is technically referred-to as hypermedia (or hyperlinks within hypertext).
- Everything you need is in the request

### Client-server architecture

---

- The uniform interface separates clients from servers
- *Abstraction* between client and server
- Can change the server without modifying the client, vice versa
- Example: database is too slow, replace portions of it with key-value store like Redis

### Stateless

---

- Everything needed to handle the request is in the request itself
    - URI, query-string parameters, body, or headers
- After the server does it's processing, the appropriate state, or the piece(s) of state that matter, are communicated back to the client via headers, status and response body.

### Cacheable

---

- Clients cache some kinds of responses to eliminate requests
    - Example: cache an image so you don't load it every time
- Responses must implicitly or explicitly define themselves as cacheable
- Example: Last-Modified header

### Layered

---

- A client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the end server, or to an intermediary along the way
- No need to connect to a specific machine
- Just need the data from this URI

### Code on demand (optional)

---

- Servers are able to temporarily extend or customize the functionality of a client by transferring logic to it that it can execute.
- Examples of this may include compiled components such as Java applets and client-side scripts such as JavaScript
- Not common

## Summary

---

- A client and a server can communicate via a REST API
- Two servers can comunicate via a REST API
- Server abstracts away communication with the database
- REST APIs use HTTP
- REST APIs are machine-readable
- REST APIs usually return JSON data
